      <h3>More About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Thank you for chosing to review this site. I am a Junior at Brigham Young University-Idaho studying Cybersecurity. I am passionate about helping others and improving everyday. I work to accomplish my goals while striving to help others do the same. I believe in planning to succeed even when falling short rather than planning to fall short of succeeding. 
        
        Personal life:
        Outside of my professional pursuits, I am passionate about basketball and sports of all kinds, enjoying both playing and watching competitive events. I thrive in competitive games, whether strategic board games or digital challenges, as they push me to think critically and adapt quickly. Traveling is another passion, as it allows me to experience new cultures, gain fresh perspectives, and step out of my comfort zone. Most importantly, I value spending time with my wife and family, which keeps me grounded and motivated. These hobbies shape my resilience, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, all of which translate into my professional life.
